# Progression Pathway
1) Initial submission to check format is right and that problem is correctly understood
2) Get general strings to enums to work
3) Simple dictionary usage from turns to generate statistics of dictionary usage (good players probably use obscure words)
4) Generate point statistics of turns to plug into model
5) Details point responses between players in turns to generate how much better they are (can they control endgames)
